# Raytracer
## About
This is a project I completed for my CS116A class with Kevin Smith. Professor Smith provided our class with a lot of helpful starter code and was a great help in learning about computer rendering, so I want to thank him for that.
My raytracer is written in C++ using the OpenFrameworks toolkit. Right now, it can render a scene with basic primitive shapes, featuring Blinn-Phong lighting as well as basic cel-shading. It supports loading in textures onto planes as background imagery.
